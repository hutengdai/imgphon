# image-pca
Python toolkit for feature extraction from, and dimensionality reduction of, video and ultrasound for data-driven articulatory phonetic analysis of lip and tongue shapes. Primarily built on `scikit-learn`, `opencv3`, and `dlib`.

# Getting started
### Installing dependencies
`opencv3`, `ffmpeg`, and `dlib` are all required. The dependencies for `dlib` are large and rather complex. We have used the installation instructions for Unix-type systems at goo.gl/MH1SZT with some success. The instructions provided at `davisking/dlib` may also help.

### Usage
Coming soon

### Demo
A demonstration of lip shape extraction and dimensionality reduction can be found in lip-demo.ipynb.
