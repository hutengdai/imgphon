# image-pca
Processing scripts for principle components analysis of ultrasound images, as well as associated (meta)data (experimental context, time-aligned acoustic data, and so on). 

# Assumptions
Data structures are generated by ultracomm and ultratils libraries (see https://github.com/rsprouse). Ultrasound image data should be unconverted (in rectangular format) BPR to start with. Directory structure is assumed to be based around the acquisition: a collection of similarly named files with different extensions attached to a common base name, along with a few automatically generated troubleshooting files (stim.txt, versions.txt, etc) that have the same name for every acquisition.
