# image-pca
Processing scripts for principle components analysis of ultrasound images.

Ultrasound image data should be unconverted (in rectangular format) BPR to start with. Directory structure is assumed to be based around the acquisition: a collection of similarly named files with different extensions attached to a common base name, along with a few automatically generated troubleshooting files (stim.txt, versions.txt, etc) that have the same name for every acquisition.
